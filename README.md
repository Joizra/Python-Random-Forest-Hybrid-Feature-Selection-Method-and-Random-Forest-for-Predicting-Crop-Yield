# Python-Hybrid Feature Selection Method and Random Forest for Predicting Crop Yield
This project proposes a hybrid method that combines causal discovery and backward feature selection for selecting features, along with the Random Forest algorithm for training the dataset to develop a predictive model capable of estimating crop yields.
